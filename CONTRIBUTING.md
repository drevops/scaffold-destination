## What forms of contribution are we looking for?

Any form of contribution to DrevOps Vortex, be it rectifying a bug, proposing
a new feature, or enhancing our documentation, is highly appreciated. We are
glad for your willingness to assist!

## I've discovered a problem

We're constantly eager to address any issues, so your reports are always

Fantastic! Please [submit your idea](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/issues)
