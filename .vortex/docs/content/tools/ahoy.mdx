with zero code and dependencies.

Usually, Ahoy is used to wrap the commands to make the development workflow
consistent and easy to use.

**Vortex** comes with [pre-configured Ahoy file](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/.ahoy.yml) that has
commands wrapped around the most common tasks:

- Working with containers
- Building the project locally
- Running tests
- Running code quality checks

It also provides an example of [local Ahoy file](https://github.com/drevops/scaffold/blob/develop/.ahoy.local.example.yml)
to be used in your projects. Once copied to `.ahoy.local.yml`, the file will
be excluded from the repository and can be used to add local project-specific
commands.

## Usage

```shell
# Run a command in the global Ahoy file.
ahoy COMMAND [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]

# Run a command in the local Ahoy file.
ahoy local COMMAND [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]

# Show all available commands.
ahoy --help
```

## Configuration

See [configuration reference](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy#example-of-new-yaml-setup-in-v2).

Adding a new command with passed arguments:

```yml
commands:
  custom:
    cmd: .vendor/bin/phpunit --group="smoke" "$@"
```

Adding a new multi-line command with usage details and calling another Ahoy
commands after confirmation:

```yml

commands:
  custom:
    usage: Custom action
    cmd: |
      ahoy confirm "Are you sure?" &&
      .vendor/bin/phpunit --group="smoke" "$@" &&
      ahoy info
```

### Environment variables

The configuration is set up to load environment variables from `.env` and
`.env.local` files, giving the precedence to the values in the existing
environment. See more details in the [Variables](../workflows/variables.mdx)
section.
